# Trip Planner ELD - Hours of Service Compliance Application

A comprehensive web application designed for property-carrying truck drivers to plan trips while maintaining compliance with FMCSA Hours of Service (HOS) regulations.

## üöõ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Trip Planning**: Input current location, pickup, and drop-off locations
- **HOS Compliance**: Automatic calculation based on 70-hour/8-day cycle
- **Route Mapping**: Visual route display with stops and rest breaks
- **ELD Log Generation**: Automatically generated daily log sheets with visual grids
- **Real-time Calculations**: Accurate driving hours, on-duty time, and cycle management

### Key Inputs
- Current location (with address autocomplete suggestions)
- Pickup location
- Drop-off location  
- Current cycle hours used (0-70 hours)
- Sleeper berth preferences
- Fuel stop requirements

### Outputs
- **Interactive Route Map**: Shows complete route with all required stops
- **Daily ELD Logs**: Visual log sheets with proper HOS status tracking
- **Compliance Verification**: Real-time validation of HOS regulations
- **Stop Information**: Detailed breakdown of rest breaks, fuel stops, and delivery times

## üõ°Ô∏è HOS Compliance Features

### Assumptions Built Into Logic
- Property-carrying driver under 70-hour/8-day cycle
- No adverse driving conditions
- Automatic fuel stops every 1,000 miles
- 1 hour allocated for pickup and drop-off activities
- 30-minute rest break required after 8 cumulative driving hours
- 10 consecutive hours off-duty required for daily reset
- 11-hour daily driving limit with 14-hour driving window

### Advanced HOS Features
- **Sleeper Berth Provisions**: Support for 7+3 and 8+2 splits
- **34-Hour Restart**: Automatic suggestion when approaching cycle limits
- **Multi-day Trip Planning**: Generates multiple log sheets for longer hauls
- **Compliance Warnings**: Real-time alerts for potential violations

## üó∫Ô∏è Map Integration

The application includes an interactive route map that displays:
- Complete route from current location to pickup to delivery
- Required rest stops and their durations
- Fuel stops every 1,000 miles
- Sleeper berth locations (when applicable)
- Time stamps for each stop
- Mileage tracking

*Note: In production, this would integrate with real mapping APIs like OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, or MapBox for live routing data.*

## üìä ELD Log Sheets

### Visual Log Generation
- **24-Hour Grid Display**: Canvas-based drawing of status periods
- **Color-Coded Status**: Different colors for Off-Duty, Sleeper, Driving, On-Duty
- **Automatic Calculations**: Real-time totals for each duty status
- **FMCSA Compliance**: Logs follow official ELD format requirements
- **Multi-Day Support**: Separate log sheets for trips spanning multiple days

### Log Features
- Driver certification and signature
- Vehicle and carrier information
- Detailed remarks for each status change
- Mileage tracking
- PDF export capability (ready for integration)
- Print-friendly formatting

- **Tablet**: Stacked sections with touch-optimized controls
- **Mobile**: Accordion-style navigation with large buttons

## üöÄ Production Deployment

For full production deployment, the application would include:

1. **Django Backend**:
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Trip calculation APIs
   - Database models for users, trips, and logs
   - PDF generation services
   - Real-time mapping integration

2. **Database Schema**:
   - User profiles and preferences
   - Trip history and calculations
   - ELD log storage
   - Compliance audit trails

3. **External Integrations**:
   - Real mapping APIs for accurate routing
   - Geocoding services for address lookup
   - Weather services for condition alerts
   - Fleet management system integration

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development

This application is currently implemented as a React frontend with mock data. To run locally:

1. The application uses modern React components
2. All calculations are client-side for demonstration
3. Mock data simulates real trip calculations
4. Canvas drawing provides realistic ELD log visualization

## üìã Compliance Notes

This application is designed to assist with HOS compliance but should not replace proper driver training and awareness of current FMCSA regulations. Always consult official FMCSA resources for the most up-to-date requirements.

### Key Regulations Addressed
- 49 CFR Part 395 - Hours of Service of Drivers
- Electronic Logging Device (ELD) requirements
- Property-carrying vehicle regulations
- Interstate commerce compliance
